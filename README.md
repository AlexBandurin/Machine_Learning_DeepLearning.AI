# Machine_Learning Specialization Assignments

Here are my programming assignments from the Machine Learning Specialization by DeepLearning.AI, taught by Andrew Ng.
I got to explore the fundamental concepts in ML. 

Below are links to the notebooks in this repository along with the topics covered/assignment overview.

- **Gradient descent** 
  Using gradient descent to minimize a cost function. 
  [Linear Regression - Course 1, Week 2](https://(https://github.com/AlexBandurin/Machine_Learning_DeepLearning.AI/blob/master/C1_W2_Linear_Regression.ipynb)
  
  

- **Neural Networks** for Handwritten Digit Recognition (Multiclass Classification):
  Here, I trained a neural network to recognize handwritten digits 0-9 using **Tensorflow**.
  The model features 2 hidden layers with a ReLU activation functions and an output layer with linear activation,
  to which a Softmax function is applied to categorize the output into the appropriate "digit" category. Below is a diagram:
